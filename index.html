<p>Found in north-central Alabama, Birmingham is the stateâ€™s most populous. Birmingham is also the seat of Jefferson County. Even though it
 has the most population it is the youngest of the major cities in Alabama. Birmingham was founded in 1871 where two railroad lines cross, 
 near one of the world's richest deposits of minerals. The city was named for the Birmingham in the UK which is the center of the UK's iron 
 industry. The Alabama city grew so quickly that it became to be known as the "Magic City". Later it became known as the "Pittsburgh of the 
 south" because of all the iron and steel products. Birmingham has gone through booms, busts, labor unrest, and civil rights tragedies and 
 triumphs. Today Birmingham is one of the largest banking centers and world-class medical facilities. Birmingham had a mayor-council form of 
 government. They reelect for mayor and nine council members every four years. Birmingham is found in Jones Valley which is one of the 
 southernmost valleys of the Appalachian mountain chain. Gen. Andrew Jackson's army that defeated the Creeks at Horseshoe Bend were the first 
 Europeans to reach the area in 1815. With lacking transportation to connect early settlements such as Jonesboro, Elyton to the rest of the 
 state. Little abundant soil began to benefit to the state's cotton economy. In the first half of the nineteenth century the area began to slowly
  grow. After the Civil War the invention of railroads  within the Jones Valley along with rich minerals nearby created the way for finding 
  Birmingham. When people realized the area's potential, a group of  investors and promoters of the north and south railroad met with a banker
  by the name of Josiah Morris in Montgomery on December 18, 1870. They organized the Elyton land company to build a new city in Jefferson
  County. The company met again in January of 1871, and they choose their president to be James R.  Powell who had recently came from
  Birmingham, England's iron and steel center. He suggested that the new Alabama industrial center should be called Birmingham too. As a 
  flamboyant and a colorful promoter for the proposed city, Powell became known as the "Duke of Birmingham." He advertised all of the state 
  and even the nation saying that lots of land would be for sale in the new city on June 1 1871. Six months after the lots sold, Birmingham was
  chartered by the state of Alabama legislature on December 19, 1871 Governor Robert Lindsay appointed Robert Henley to a two year term as 
  Birmingham's first mayor. In 1873, Powell (the president of the Elyton Land Company) was elected mayor and quickly had the legislature 
  call for a vote that residents could choose between Elyton and Birmingham to become the Jefferson County seat. In a bitter challenge, 
  Powell courted newly enfranchised African-Americans, who voted overwhelmingly for Birmingham. </p>
